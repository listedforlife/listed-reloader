Miami's m.O.N.R.O.E Talks New EP on Get Physical and Release Party at Treehouse

Sean Levisman | April 24, 2015 | 12:41pm

If you hadn't heard of m.O.N.R.O.E., AKA Jordan Postrel, yet, it was only a matter of time, because this local Miami DJ-producer is blowing  up in a big way this year.



Auspicious collaborations with DV8 label boss Daniel Dubb put Postrel on the international tech-house radar in 2014. And most recently, homeboy has dropped a new EP on Get Physical, one of the top labels on the global scene.



With an energetic groove-heavy sound shot through with exuberant classic house flavors, the new Moonset EP certainly puts m.O.N.R.O.E. among Miami's most promising new electronic dance music ambassadors to the world.



Ahead of the record release party at Treehouse Miami on Saturday, we here at New Times caught up with Postrel to find out more about this talented local.
