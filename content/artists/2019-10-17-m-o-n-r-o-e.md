\[GET PHYSICAL, DESERT HEARTS, KINDISCH, CUTTIN' HEADZ]



Spawned from the producer of James Brown, comes a youthful, diligent and proficient producer/DJ - **m.O.N.R.O.E.** (aka Jordan Postrel), has firmly stamped his mark in the industry, churning out tracks for the iconic **Get Physical** label to name just one of his outstanding accolades.

With a stint in the fashion industry working with the world’s biggest fashion *brands*, m.O.N.R.O.E. turned to production and DJ'ing full time at the ripe age of 17. Unlike most young producers m.O.N.R.O.E.'s first release was on **Steve Lawler**'s label - **VIVa MUSiC** with his EP - *Don't Flex* [co-produced by DVB label boss, **Daniel Dubb**]. This became the catalyst towards the interest and signing with his dream label - **Get Physical** with a string of EP's, vinyl releases and compilation mixes. Other label ’s ears picked up on his talents which lead to releases on **Saved Records,** **ln motion Music, Desert Hearts, Kindisch, Akbal, and \*T​he Martinez Brothers\****’ own **Cuttin' Headz** label*.  

m.O.N.R.O.E.'s wide range of inspiration has been helped with residing in some of the world's greatest cities including  *Berlin,* Paris, New York, Ibiza and Burning Man's Black Rock City. With this and the culmination from being a self-taught engineer as well as guidance from mentors like the legendary **John Aquaviva**, **Machine Drum,** and the almighty **M.A.N.D.Y**, it’s no wonder he has arrived at such forward thinking artistry. Current works include projects with **Dance Spirit** and upcoming releases on **Atish** and **Mark Slee**’s artistic label - **Manjumasi**, as well as **a *Remix of M.A.N.D.Y. on Get Physical and many others pending.***

Notable performances include Berlin's **Watergate**, **Sisyphos** ​and **Katerblau** \[Berlin], **SXM Festival** \[St. Martin], **Vujaday Festival** \[Barbados], **Velvet** ​and **One Loft** \[Canada], **Output** \[New York], **Desert Hearts Festival** \[Warner Springs, CA], **Space** and **Ill Points Festival** \[Miami], **Elements Festival** \[Pennsylvania], **Sound Nightclub** \[Los Angeles], and last but not least the infamous **Burning Man** camps **Robot Heart**, **Pile Palace**, ***Pink Mammoth,*** **Big Imagination** (747), and **Monkey Love** *which he helps books the talent* and curates the music. 

The future looks bright for m.O.N.R.O.E., as there is no stopping his creative perpetuation anytime soon, so stay tuned!!!
