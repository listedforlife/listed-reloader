\[NATURKLANG, FRONT LEFT, NEIN. TACHNO]

Tony y Not’s rousing blends of house music are as razor sharp as she is. She bounces between clean and upbeat rhythms with agility to funky build-ups to dark synth disco. A DJ, producer and cosmic event planner, she whips up unapologetic musical cocktails geared to make you move - listen for yourself on her latest EP ‘Imperfection’ with the Hamburg based label tächno.

With sonic influences taking off from her native Germany and evolving to the tune of her travels, Tony y Not fuses together dynamic tones of European dance music and colourful multi-genre grooves embraced during her Brooklyn years. Her passion for connecting with dance floors and intimate immersive spaces led to event productions with Front Left and BAE collective, sprinkling New York nightlife with effervescent evenings and providing a platform for female identifying artists to create.

From venues and parties like Output and ZERO to festivals like Burning Man, Tony y Not uses music as a tool to communicate what words cannot, empowering crowds to smile, look forward, and not take themselves too seriously. As she continues to build international momentum and ripping through beats with spunk and positivity keep in mind she could be coming for you next.
