\[MANJUMASI] 

The Atish experience: dynamic, emotive, ecstatic. Yet it is more than the sounds emanating from the speakers, it is also the man behind the decks: warm, compassionate, inviting. He is an entertainer and a catalyst: a magician who mixes deep melodies and sophisticated rhythms into musical journeys.

Based in New York, Atish has cultivated a devoted following around the world. He’s a natural performer who engages crowds with charm and a smile. An obsessive music collector, Atish pulls from a broad sonic palette, and with these sounds he creates intimate atmospheres and emotional experiences that linger in your mind long after the music has stopped.

Atish’s passion goes far beyond the decks as well. As cofounder of the Manjumasi record label, he has created an outlet for other artists’ music as well as his own productions. His work has also found a home on prestigious imprints such as Anjunadeep, Kindisch, and Stil Vor Talent.

As a pertinent voice in the electronic scene, Atish has also hosted his own Late Night Tonite! Party series, which combines a sit-down talk show interview with an all-night dance party. This format provides a richer context for the music and strengthens the emotional bonds between the audience and the artist. For Atish, it allows him to experiment with what dance music is and what it can be.

Intimacy and connection are the foundations of the Atish experience. His multiple residencies speak to Atish’s ability to resonate with any crowd and highlight the range of his sound. From the blissed-out festival vibes of Desert Hearts, to the big city sophistication of New York’s The Cityfox Experience, and the small club coziness of Miami’s Do Not Sit On The Furniture, Atish brings people together with music and passion.

This passion can be heard on Atish’s numerous DJ mixes found on Soundcloud. A prolific mixer, Atish finds the DJ mix the perfect format to create compelling narratives of rhythm and sound. Scrolling through his extensive catalog of mixes, one can hear an artist devoted to the music and dedicated to the perfection of his craft. It’s the same devotion Atish receives back from crowds and fans the world over. They understand it’s more than the music and the crowd and the DJ, it’s the magic that awakens when it all comes together.

Atish’s ability to create a special atmosphere is perfectly summarized through his Atish All Night series. With full creative control over the venue, sound, decoration, and music, the party encompasses all that Atish has come to love about dance music through his illustrious career. After sellout shows in LA, New York and San Francisco, the open-to-close nights have established themselves as truly memorable parties. After all, it is the inimitable Atish experience.
