 \[THE WITCHING HOUR, POKERFLAT, SUPERFREQ, AKBAL, KWENCH, WILD WOLVES ON ACID, BEDROCK] 

Foremost Jay Tripwire is a Dj and his craft goes back to when every party was vinyl only and there was no sync button, an ethos still to this day Jay adheres to.

Tripwire is getting old and has over 25 years under his belt professionally as a DJ and has toured extensively for 20 years with gigs taking him to over 200 cities worldwide.

He might have blood clots from all that flying, but he drinks alot of fish oil. #notvegan

His finely crafted extended sets deviate from the norm and as a DJ he encompasses a very wide range of underground music, and decades of digging for music to which his ears, neck and back

have taken a serious beating from shows in how he walks with a swagger. #arthritis

Jay prepares extensively for every set of gigs with his personally crafted re edits to match his signature style of long drawn out blends create a rich tapestry of audio,

where its not easy to tell where one song starts and the other ends (unless your a fucking shazzam nerd).

A sometimes resident at Mr. C's legendary SuperFreq parties and a regular contributor to the label,

some of the notable Label parties have been at BPM festival, NYC for Resolute, Alec Baldwins 63rd birthday, and of course Fabric in London.

Jay Has played many of the worlds top clubs, ones that are current, ones that only older people would know and many underground spots that didn't have a fancy name- just sweaty walls.

Jay has not played any of the top clubs in Ibiza and only 2 in Berlin, Jay doesnt front on that. #crossfit

Always sitting slightly off-centre, Jay Tripwire is an artist that walks the line as industry staple and ever changing innovator, releasing one standout release after another.

It was his early vinyl releases that cemented his place as an originator that led to releasing over 300 vinyl records and hundreds of digital projects,

and his accumulated sales are in the millions, and despite that statement sounding fancy- Jay has never owned a sports car or property anywhere. #ghettofab

Jay has been in the Beatport top 100 since 2014 every single month, and hit the chart in almost every genre despite never being nominated for an oscar for his work on the soundtrack to Ben Hur.

Most recently a remix of Mr. C's "Stand Up" on Superfreq was recognized as one of 2017's best remixes by DJ Mag, and so were some others, but we only care about Jay's achievements in this bio.

Currently he has been exploring working at different tunings using 432 and 528 and writing things with certain healing frequencies in mind and his last full length album titled "8channels"

was the first outing in this new direction, in 2018 Jay is working on a new singles for Superfreq, Akbal, a collaboration with Brett Johnson for Cassy's label, starting a new minimal vinyl project with

the Under G crew in Vancouver, and a bunch of vinyl only and digital remixes for many other labels.

Jay mostly wears mostly black and has for a very long time, because black doesnt look dirty when you tour, he takes the lyrics from Johnny Cash "Man in Black" to heart. The current trend

of a Dj playing dark underground ground music and wearing all black probably stems from Jay Tripwire. #unlikelytrendsetter
