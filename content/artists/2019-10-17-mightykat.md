MightyKat was born with a sixth sense for rhythm. A native Montrealer, Dominique Thibault launched her career in 1998 and released her first mix CD "Confidence" in 2001, earning her praise both at home and abroad. Since then, she’s become a player on the international scene while continuing to organize and promote local events. She is also label partner of Pronto Musique with producer, Miguel Graça.



Counting her main influences as jazz, disco, and soul, MK’s unique sound bridges eclectic house and the funkier side of techno. Her sophisticated style, refined track selection, and tight mixing skills define her signature sound, while her love of the dance floor drives her musical intuition wherever she plays.



A veteran of the Montreal electronic music scene, MK was co-founder and promoter of the wildly successful “Dizzy” night, at Salon Daomé (2003-2007), introducing the city to the likes of Ricardo Villalobos, Luciano, Zip, Sammy Dee, Junction SM, and many more. In the past decade, she’s held down several residencies at local clubs such as Circus Afterhours, and more recently at Stereo and Cherry. She has also played alongside Cassy, dOP, Droog, Lee Foss, Richie Hawtin, Magda, Derrick L. Carter, Doc Martin, and Herbert.



She is a regular guest at Piknic Electronik, and played Igloofest in 2010. She performed at Montreal’s International Jazz Festival in both 2002 & 2006, FCMM’s Media Lounge, BBCM’s Red Party, and was the musical programmer for Quebec’s prestigious comic awards, the Gala Des Oliviers from 2005-2007.



Internationally, she’s been heard bringing down the house at prestigious clubs like Club der visionnares (Berlin), The Marcy Hotel and Bunker (NYC), Batofar and Nouveau Casino (Paris), Weetamix (Geneva), MetroDance club (Spain), and held down a monthly residency at Rome’s club Hulala in Italy. One of the first international guests at La Santanerra in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, she left her indelible mark at this year’s BPM Festival.



Developing her sound as a producer, she released her first remix “And on now” on Pronto Musique in the summer of 2011. Her true passion for the music, continue to propel her towards exciting new projects.



In addition, she has participated at Montreal’s International Jazz Festival 2002 & 2006, Gala Des Oliviers 2005-2007, L'Autre Gala de l'ADISQ 2008, FCMM’s Media Lounge, BBCM’s Red Party and has also played alongside Troy Pierce, Magda, Derrick L. Carter, Mark Farina, Johnny Fiasco, Phil Weeks, Luke Solomon, East Coast Boogiemen, Doc Martin & Herbert.



Today, MK continues to DJ regularly within Canada, in Europe and Mexico, continuing to leave her mark on the international scene with her solid performances, perseverance, determination and most importantly a true passion for the music and the scene.
