Hailing from San Francisco, Mark Slee is known to wear many creative hats. But two of his all-time favorite fashions are that of DJ and producer. Since co-founding House-Heads in 2008, a collective combining forward-thinking music with a quirky undergr..



Over the course of an obsession with dance music now more than 15 years strong, Slee has evolved a style of deep house that reflects a unique personality, balancing intricate grooves, dreamy textures, and playful whimsical bounce. Blending his technical side with intuition and introspection, he takes an approach that tickles both mind and soul.



Slee's sets have taken him far and wide, playing for audiences from Cape Town to Playa del Carmen, from Robot Heart to the Cityfox series in NYC. On the home front, his penchant for diverse and well-crafted warmup sets sees him regularly playing SF's top clubs, opening for DJs like Danny Tenaglia, Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, Matthew Dear, Guy Gerber, Matthew Dekay, Vincenzo, Andre Lodemann, and Hector.



Rounding things out are his original productions and remixes, released on Cityfox, Proton Music, Loöq Records, Tenampa, and Submarine Vibes.
