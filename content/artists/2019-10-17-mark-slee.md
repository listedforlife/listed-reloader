Over the course of an obsession with dance music now more than 15 years strong, Slee has evolved a style of deep house that reflects a unique personality, balancing intricate grooves, dreamy textures, and playful whimsical bounce. Blending his technical side with intuition and introspection, he takes an approach that tickles both mind and soul.

Slee's sets have taken him far and wide, playing for audiences from Cape Town to Playa del Carmen, from Robot Heart to the Cityfox series in NYC.

Rounding things out are his original productions and remixes, released on Cityfox, Proton Music, Lo√∂q Records, Tenampa, and Submarine Vibes.
