\[NO. 19]

With two decades of experience within the house and techno industry, Nitin Kalyan’s depth of knowledge and work ethic is second to none. The Canadian artist has not only established himself as a highly skilled and polished DJ on the global circuit, but he also lends his uncanny musical ability to events promotion, label management, A&R, curating festival line-ups and marketing campaigns, as well as producing his own music. Having such a diverse range of skills means he is one of the most adept and influential artists to have come out of Canada and places him at the forefront of the ever-evolving worldwide scene.

Nitin’s story begins with Detroit, the techno mecca that has spawned an endless lineage of talent over the last 30 years. The sounds that emanated from Motor City through his radio in London, Ontario left an indelible imprint and inspired him to embark on a career that continues to flourish to this very day. Record shopping in Detroit led to a meeting with Mike Huckaby and Nitin subsequently playing the legendary Shelter at the age of 17. From there on in his fate was sealed…

From throwing parties in his hometown, to relocating to Toronto in 2005, Nitin proved his worth as a music lover, bolstering his DJ skills with regular gigs and becoming a prominent promoter in both London, Ontario and Toronto. Through his endeavours he established himself as a key protagonist within Canada’s fertile house and techno scene. In a short space of time he was not only touring across much of North America but also making regular visits to Europe, playing some of the continent’s most legendary clubs, including DC10 (Ibiza), Panorama Bar (Berlin), Fabric (London), Showcase (Paris) and Nordstern (Basel). His years of experience inform every set; presenting music that holds true to the spirit of house and techno music, played with panache and dexterity.

Besides his dynamic DJ displays, Nitin also runs the highly regarded No.19 record label with Art Department’s Jonny White. The label is renowned for its forward-thinking, avant-garde take on house and techno, signing music from both established artists and nurturing new talent with everyone from old hands like Kerri Chandler and Jerome Sydenham to newcomers such as Eric Volta and Jakkin Rabbit producing music for the outlet. Nitin has played a pivotal role in managing the label and steering it to its current standing as one of the scene’s most influential and much respected music platforms.

Outside of touring Nitin is dedicating an increasing amount of time to his work in the studio. Detroit’s influence remains present, pouring into his productions, combined with two decades worth of unrelenting passion and hard work within the industry. With a string of releases since 2008, including EPs on his own imprint No.19, along with My Favorite Robot and Definitive Records, his hunger to produce is clear to see. This unrelenting drive fuels weekly sessions in the studio, the results of which will be revealed in the coming months.

In every aspect of his multi-faceted career Nitin injects passion, dedication and an unwavering thirst to keep striving to be the very best he can be. It’s the catalyst behind a career that has already lasted 20 years and will no doubt continue for many years to come…
