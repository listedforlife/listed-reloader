ves is an internationally-acclaimed DJ, producer and label owner. A founding member of the trailblazing group Visionquest, his influence reaches far beyond the cities he has called home and stretches around the globe.



Growing up in Michigan and brought up musically on a diet of house and techno in nearby Detroit, Shaun moved to the city in his late teens and began organizing small club nights and loft parties with his friends.



Upon getting involved in the Detroit Scene, Shaun was immediately influenced heavily by the more minimal sounds from djs/artists such as Daniel Bell, Magda and especially from Zip and the Perlon label. This influence and a search for new inspiration led Shaun to take a summer holiday to Berlin in 2004 that turned into 10 years living in the city. In this time his deft touch as a DJ won him fans on dance floors from Panorama Bar to Fabric, DC10, Robert Johnson and countless other highly influential underground clubs.



Combined with his time on the road with Visionquest, Shaun Reeves has covered much of the globe over the past decade, enthralling audiences on both sides of the Atlantic with his own highly distinctive mixture of American house, both classic and contemporary, and the deepest, most cutting edge aspects of post-minimal techno and tech-house. .



In tandem with his DJing, Shaun Reeves has maintained a consistent level of production work, releasing on labels such as Wolf + Lamb, Raum...Musik, Catwash, No. 19 Music and his own Visionquest imprint. The artist is also an in- demand remixer, contributing remixes for Visionquest/ David Lynch, Tracy Thorn, Dop, Dinky (Sven Väth’s label Cocoon).



Today, Shaun Reeves is determined to focus on his solo career and wishes to explore new possibilities in terms of musical creation. With plans afoot for a slew of high-quality releases, which embody his leftfield yet accessible take on house and techno, his release schedule for the coming year is already looking busier than ever.
