Sinca is a Montreal-based artist with a deftly-crafted dance-floor sound, fusing
hypnotic grooves, powerful bass-lines and lush, uplifting synth-work. The fast
emerging DJ and Producer is a dedicated proponent of the city’s thriving
underground, rising through the ranks to garner support from global tastemaker
Anjunadeep. The London-based imprint delivered her debut release ‘Mancora’
in 2021 with strong support from mainstays James Grant and Jody Wisternoff.


Raised in the French capital of Canada to a Peruvian household, Sinca’s eclectic
journey and upbringing has brought an inimitable flavour to her sound and an
undeniable joy to her performances. As an avid Épicurienne and a former dancer
of classical ballet and rhythmic flamenco, her creative exploits and inquisitive
tastes inspire evolving sets that elevate the senses and offer a transcendent
experience on the floor.


Having her cut her craft with performances at the likes of Piknic Electronik, Salon
Daomé and Newspeak, Sinca has since taken flight with debuts in Mexico, the
Dominican Republic, France, Czech Republic and beyond. Now with a steadfast
focus on the studio and eyes on the horizon, 2022 will be a breakout year for the
Anjunadeep artist..
