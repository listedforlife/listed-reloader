In September 2007, when Tara Danielle Brooks, put her first needle on her record, she had no idea nor expectation, that her passion for music would soon become her life-long career. She learned to spin records using her naturally talented ear for music. Through this new route, she escaped into the sounds that helped her discover a new meaning to life.



’I’ll never forget losing myself for hours in our local record store, flipping through endless records in search for the perfect sounds and base, Tara says. I remember getting so deeply involved in the tracks that time felt nonexistent."



Experiencing endless, priceless nights at clubs, parties, & festivals in Southern California, Tara discovered the power to be moved & touched by electronic dance music causing pure enlightenment. Shes a self-taught deejay who found her destiny was to express her creativity through music. She was born on May 26, 1982 in Studio City, Ca. Her love for music was cultivated at an early age. Being raised by a father who played guitar, a mother who sang, played piano, and harp, she was destined to utilize music in a unique career. Tara grew up knowing she was here to do something creative that would touch the world. At the age of 10, she performed her first acting role in the movie Frozen Assets with actress Shelly Long. However, when graduating with a Bachelors degree in communication from San Diego State University, she did not predict that she would discover this special path meant for her.



Tara grew up listening to her mother’s Beatles records & grew to fall in love with multiple genres including alternative rock, classic rock, punk rock, ambient, & even soothing meditating tunes. She favored Incubus, Tool, NIN, Sublime, Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Enya, & Tori Amos. When introduced to electronic music she was blown away by a new world of base, beats, sounds, & melodies that had the ability to take you on a journey. She’s fallen in love with all genres of house, but her heart lies in techno, tech house, tribal house, dark progressive, & recently has been exposed to psy-trance. Tara explained that when she refer’s to “dark”, she means the tone, the mood, the intensity of base, that almost gives you an out of body experience, but is amazingly uplifting & beautiful.



Tara has spent many nights dancing to many talented djs, capturing her inspiration and passionate connection for great body-moving music. Dj’s who have inspired her, touched her heart & influenced her include James Zabiela, Trent Cantrelle, Noel Sanger, Adam Beyer, Chus and Ceballos, Niaz Arca, Andy Notalez, Carl Cox, Sasha & Digweed, D Formation, Neelix, Suntree, Victor Calderone and many others. Her mind has been opened to a multitude of genres. One day while experimenting with a few of her favorite records, she successfully mixed the beats of In My Arms by Mylo Vs. Tocadisco & Deep Dishs Dreams. She said, “The sounds created were so beautiful and felt so insanely good, tears ran down my face.” This turned her passion into an addiction, causing her unique talent to elevate her deejay performance, landing her gigs at Las Vegas venues, such as Empire Ballroom, the Hard Rock Hotel Pool, Body English, Drai’s, Vanity, & Wet Republic.



Tara has also performed in a variety of San Diego venues, such as On Broadway, Spin, Thin and Onyx, Se’ Hotel, Hard Rock Hotel, and has gained residencies at the Ivy Hotel and Voyeur. She has also been playing Hollywood hot spots such as Hyde, Mi-6, Villa, Green Door, Drais, & Ecco. From Scottsdale, to Beta in Denver, and playing 2 events at the Winter Music Conference in Miami 09, and booked for 8 events at WMC 2010, Taras audience is moved and deeply inspired by her music, energy, and passion. Her success in the U.S. has already taken her internationally to Mexico & Canada.



With ten radio show/podcast mixes already under her belt in about two years, and a booked deejay schedule, her creative vision is on the way to becoming a reality.



Tara has finally found what makes her happy and is now full filling her purpose for being here.. As the days go by, she’s filled with creative ideas & has just begun working with computer production programs, such as Ableton & Logic. She has begun learning from friend Touvan Soughierto, a brilliant producer. They are now working on remixes, tracks, using her vocals, and anything creative and unique.



After being moved so deeply by music from dj and producer Niaz Arca, from Stockholm Sweden, she decided to reach out to him. Tara believes that those whose music has the ability to touch you, have proven to be the most passionate, humble, genuine good people.. As she predicted Niaz was exactly that. It only took a few conversations to know she would start making music with Niaz and his lifelong friend & talented partner, Andy Notalez. Having found new ways to express herself, she is pleased to say “only the sky is the limit”.



Look out for Tara. She’s focused, motivated, and ready to share what moves her with the world.
