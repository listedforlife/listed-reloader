\[SUPERFREQ] 

Richard West aka Mr.C was born in London in the late 60's. He started MCing in London clubs aged 16 & soon earned a reputation as a fast talking vivacious rapper working with LWR radio's Ron Tom, Jasper the Vinyl Junkie & Jazzy M. Mr.C then hooked up with Colin Faver & Evil Eddie Richards to became resident rapper at the legendary Camden Palace in London, going on to MC for Colin Faver on the then illegal pirate radio station Kiss FM. Mr.C went into the studio to record his 1st house track with Eddie Richards as Myster-E which was released in August 1987. This inspired Mr.C to become a DJ to learn more about his beloved House & Techno music so in September 1987 Richard took to the decks. Mr.C has since organized, promoted & been resident DJ at: Fantasy ('88), Base (Dungeons '89), Release (91), Harmony (92), Drop (93), Cyclone (94), Vapourspace (94 & 95), Flavour (The End 95 & 96), Subterrain (The End 95 - 2002), Superfreq (Worldwide 2002 - Present), Super Disco Freq (LA 2010 - present). Mr.C was also resident DJ every weekend (Friday & Saturday nights) at the legendary RIP parties at Clink Street in London throughout 1988. It was here that Rave Culture as we know it was truly born, inspiring all London raves that were to follow in 88, 89 & 90.

Mr.C held down a weekly radio show called Future Music with Kiss 100FM in London from 1993-2002 & has presented TV shows for MTV, FH1, VIVA & BBC. To say that Mr.C is one of the most iconic DJs in the world would be an understatement.

In December 1995 Mr.C opened the legendary nightclub The End in London with Partner Layo Paskin of Layo & Bushwacka! fame & then AKA bar 3 years later, which celebrated its 13th anniversary in December 2008 & was lauded as one of the best night clubs in the world, which completely changed the face of clubbing in London & beyond. Sadly The End & AKA closed its doors for good on January 24th 2009. 1 Chapter closes & another begins.

Mr.C is founder & owner of Plink Plonk records, co-founder of End Recordings & founder & co-owner of the Superfreq label, which is now releasing music prolifically.

Mr.C has recorded under the names, Myster-E, Unity 2, Nu Jacks, Bass Bureau, The Shamen, Mantrac, Somnambulist, Animus Amour, Killer Loop, Mr.C & Tom Parris, Mr.C & 16B, Sycophant Slags, Indigo Kidz & East LA Tek.

Mr.C is best known as front man, songwriter & producer of the pop group The Shamen with whom he notched up a string of top 10 hits including Move Any Mountain, Love Sex Intelligence, Boss Drum, Phorever People & the UK number 1 smash hit Ebeneezer Goode. These hits were hits the world over. The Shamen album Boss Drum went double platinum in the UK & they also won a highly coveted Ivor Novelo for Songwriters of the year UK in 1993. Richard's currently recording solo as Mr.C & is also doing collaborations as the Indigo Kidz with Affie Yusuf & with Noel Jackson as East LA Tek & has recent releases on Poker Flat, Get Physical Records & Adjunct Audio as well as his own Superfreq imprint.

Mr.C runs & promotes Superfreq events, which celebrated being 16 years old in March 2018 & ran monthly at Mr.C's club The End until it closed down in January 2009. Superfreq now functions bi-monthly in London hopping around London’s popup warehouse venues & various clubs including The Steelyard after an extremely successful event with Richie Hawtin on December 2015, regular events at Fabric & regular quarterly events at Red Gallery until it’s closure in July 2018. Superfreq does regular events in Los Angeles as well as bi-monthly events in Calais France & annual events in Brooklyn, Chicago, Detroit, San Francisco, Miami, Dallas, Denver & Washington DC in the United States & also Vancouver, Playa Del Carmen, Mexico DF, Moscow, Ibiza, Bogota, Montañita & other one off / annual events the world over & has recently competed an Asia tour hitting Manila, Phnom Penh, Siem Reap, Kuala Lumpur, Singapore, Beijing & Shenzhen. Superfreq has accomplished 7 successful seasons in Ibiza, 3 at Club Underground, 2 at the legendary DC10, 1 season at Blu, 3 events at Aura & hosted annual events at BPM Festival in Playa Del Carmen until it’s unfortunate closure.

Mr.C completed a world tour for his Incidents album last year, which was released on vinyl & CD on his Superfreq imprint in June 2017 with singles Stand Up, Ripple Effect & Shape Your Dreams all containing superb remixes from renowned artists. Mr.C’s brand new single Show Me with remixes by Ruede Hagelstein & Radio Rental is due shortly.
