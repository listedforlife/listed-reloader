Mike Khoury – Chicago / London (listed :: Varsity Allstars :: Lost Souls)



It’s hard to believe that once upon a time, Mike was growing up dance music deprived in suburban America. Fortunately, that all changed when friends dragged him to his first underground EDM event in Chicago. It wasn’t long before he bought turntables - and started spending more money on his records than his rent. And so began Mike’s journey into vinyl junkie-ism.



Five years later, Mike’s sets continually blur the lines between techno, minimal, and tech-house. Think fresh grooves, driving basslines, and plenty of dance floor funk to keep late night revelers on their toes. Mike draws inspiration from the cutting edge sounds coming out of Berlin without forgetting his Chicago roots.



Mike has an extensive history of opening and headlining gigs, having shared the decks with artists including Lee Burridge, Pan-Pot, Exercise One, Ambivalent, Adultnapper, Sian, Touane, Maetrik, Danny Howells, Satoshi Tomiie, Sander Kleinenberg, and Chris Fortier.



As a resident for listed, Mike’s played in San Francisco, LA, NYC, and Miami, plus countless gigs in Chicago. In 2007, he founded the Varsity Allstars – a dayraving extravaganza with quarterly parties across the US. Having launched listed in Chicago, Mike has combined DJ’ing with promotion – giving a swift jolt to Chicago’s warehouse party scene with some of the year’s most unforgettable nights.



With a recent move to London, Mike began a residency with the Lost Souls crew – giving him the chance to show his stuff for clued-in techno crowds at infamous underground venues Unit 7, The Key, and Bar 54. Mike’s become a regular favorite at Public Life, the city’s beloved underground toilet-turned-club, where his closing sets have twisted the heads on London’s most notorious dancefloor.



Mike started 2008 with a bang, with shows on two continents and multiple gigs confirmed at WMC. Watch for Mike to begin pushing his production work as he continues making his mark on the underground circuit.
