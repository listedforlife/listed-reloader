With one of the longest running shows on Proton Radio and being one of the Listed Productions residents, Naveen G has stayed ahead of the curve by bridging the gap between the late night side of the dancefloor and the summery vibes enbodied by the fame..



Naveen G is no newcomer to the scene, having made his start in 1996 hosting his own show on the influential WNUR89.3FM Streetbeat Radio that launched the careers of many of his peers originating in Chicago. Having caught the attention of world class djs with his very first productions, which were licensed to the seminal Global Underground series, Naveen G has fostered his own sound, one that is constently hailed as exploring the late night side of the dancefloor, straying far from the conventional formula, yet still garnering acclaim from DJs and clubbers alike.



From minimal to progressive and everything in between, Naveen G's productions reflect his DJing ability to adapt to the crowd or a headliner, drawing on his diverse range. Equally comfortable warming up a room properly or playing on his own deep into the night, Naveen has brought his unique and varied style to the unsuspecting dancefloors across the world from South America to Asia, where they have learned to expect the unexpected. With a long standing top 10 show on Proton Radio, a steady string of releases for 2011 with past support from Sasha, John Digweed, Satoshi Tomiie, Hernan Cattaneo and others, as well as gigs at beachside bars to international festivals alongside a wide range of DJs such as Danny Howells, Lee Burridge, Anja Schneider, Cassy, S.O.S., Spooky, Audiofly , Chris Fortier, and many others inbetween, Naveen G continues to gain new followers across the board.
