Franklin De Costa has flown mainly under the radar for a long time now, but he’s long been a favourite of electronic music fans who love to delve a little deeper. Hailing from Berlin, he’s been releasing music under a variety of monikers for well over a decade and he’s always charted his own course. Alongside his production work, Franklin also promotes the Mothers Finest night where he’s been able to continue to push the weirder, more non-conformist corners of techno and bass music. With the likes of Hodge as a resident and acts such as DJ Bone, Laurel Halo, and Machine Woman amongst his bookings you can see that they like to follow the path less trodden.
