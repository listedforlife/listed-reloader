Born in bear country on the Atnarko River in Northern Canada, Atnarko channels his
inner bear as he deejays and produces hypnotic dance music straight from the heart of
the beast. Atnarko is considered a legend of the underground house music scene in the
south. He is known for his DJ sets that extend into the wee hours of the morning, taking
adventurous partygoers deep into his musical den.


He also produced some of the early breaks records that defined the genre as it was
emerging. These include the classic, “Tunnel Vision,” cited as an early influence by
Maceo Plex, among others. As his career developed, he went on to produce many
records and moved into other genres, most notably house and techno. With close to
200 releases appearing on a wide variety of labels, Atnarko’s paw prints are firmly
planted in dance music.


His label, Infiltr8:Celebr8, continues to set the pace for underground events in \[name of
city], booking dance music friends and heroes with great success, expanding, and
elevating the city’s culture. He continues to walk this path, playing and producing music
he loves, regardless of boundaries. Atnarko has told his musical story far and wide over
his long career and he would love to tell it to you.
