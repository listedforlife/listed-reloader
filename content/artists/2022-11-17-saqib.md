Saqib has an infectious energy that quickly catches all those around him. He will

instantly make you feel at home, relevant, and loved. His humor will disarm you and his smile

will make you feel like you are part of his own family.In the same way, his dance floor

instigations light a fire that brings people together. He is an individual with a unique musical

background and singular style of music and producers and dancers alike will tell you that you

can easily pick out a Saqib DJ set and a Saqib track from the rest.

Saqib got his start in the music industry when he moved to NYC in 2013 ( for that

purpose) and became the first resident DJ for the famed Member’s Only. This was well timed

with his first release on Audiofly’s Flying Circus via a compilation by Blondish. He cut his teeth

playing records week in and week out from 2013, often sharing the decks with some of the

biggest names in the industry including Lee Burridge, Audiofly, Behrouz, Bedouin and more.

Over time, Saqib made his mark all over NYC dance floors, playing for CityFox, Bespoke Musik,

ZERO, House of Yes, Output (now closed), Cielo now closed), Knockdown Center, and so many

more.



Since his first EP in 2013, Saqib has put out more than 35 official releases consisting of

more than 75 originals and remixes, hitting Beatport #1 in the genres of deep house, tech

house, organic house, and minimal/ dub techno. These releases go alongside widely supported

edits of Pink Floyd, Billie Eilish, David Bowie, The Doors, Dr. Dre, and more. Currently he works

for Abracadabra, the label run by Blondish as a producer with an EP that made it to the Beatport

Tech House and House top 10 charts as well as doing A+R. He has an upcoming EP with

Abracadabra in 2023. He is also involved with Bye Bye Plastic’s DJ’s for climate action initiative.

Since the age of 12, Saqib has been a formal student of music, starting with guitar, bass

and drums, playing in heavy metal bands from that age until 2009. Growing up in Pakistan, he

picked up eastern classical music and sitar around the same time. With courses at school of

audio engineering in NYC, Rutgers University, Point Blank Music Academy London, iO Music

academy and DubSpot, Saqib has an extensive knowledge of music theory and music

production that is constantly growing. As a passionate and disciplined perfectionist, Saqib

embodies the picture of a musician on a lifelong creative journey; never stopping, never

satisfied, always growing, ever changing. 2021 saw Saqib Listed in top 100 producers of the

year by 1001 tracklists, a list featuring the artists who have made an impact in the industry and

are leading the sound to new places. 2022 saw EP’s on Abracadabra and the start of his own

record label, Beats On Time.

When you get Saqib, you get an individual who is real. No plastic, not fake, from the

heart and full of LOVE!
