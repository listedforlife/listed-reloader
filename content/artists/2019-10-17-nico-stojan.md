Berlin native, Nico Stojan, has been all across the planet taking people on musical journeys since the early nineties. He developed a deep love for Jazz & Hip Hop before the vibrant growth of the famous Berlin electronic nightlife.

Once the Berlin scene took flight, Nico was expressing himself with euphoric sets as a resident at Bar25. It didn’t stop there.

Since then his sound has been welcomed by seas of desert dancers, festivals of warm hearts & clubs of ecstatic ravers.

Nico’s productions find perfect harmony between analog & digital sounds, irresistable grooves accompanied by entrancing melodies.

As the co-founder of Ouïe records, together with Acid Pauli, Nico is planning to produce more showcases and present his vision of modern dance music around the globe.
