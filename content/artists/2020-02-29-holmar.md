Legend has it that Hólmar was born during the dawn of winter solstice, way up in the highlands of Iceland, to one of it’s oldest and most secret “Hidden People” communes.  Sadly his elvish mother passed from complications during birth, and one fateful night not long after,  he was found by his human adoptive parents on their doorstep. They were sheep farmers in the valley below and in a letter they found by his side, they were promised the protection of their flock in exchange for raising him as their own. Knowing the many tales of wrath inflicted on villagers not complying with their highland neighbors, they took him in straight away and Hólmar spent his formative years on their quaint farm. 

His mother, an avid swimmer, would bring him to the cold mountain lakes during the summer months and teach him all there was to know about being the best there was in the water. It was during one of these lessons, he was discovered by the national synchronized swimming coach, who by chance was hiking in the area. Enamored by Hólmar’s raw talent, he negotiated his move from the tranquil countryside to the nations capital, Reykjavik City. There he began his training and quickly became an integral member of the Icelandic squad. It was during the course of his training for the Olympics in Seoul, that he suffered a serious injury which ended his professional swimming career abruptly. Fortunately, he was able to continue his passion for synchronized group movements above water and formed a dance troupe called the “Black Widows”.  He traveled with them all over Scandinavia winning multiple competitions and dance off’s.

Throughout his time with the “Widows" he discovered his passion for music while putting together playlists for their shows. Eventually he was asked to perform these playlists "live" at parties all over Reykjavik's then bustling underground scene. After many late night gigs, not showing up to practice and seriously messing up some of their shows, he was promptly ousted from the troupe. This was a devastating moment for Holmar and after a great deal of soul searching, he moved to New York.  

There he hit the ground running and started throwing rollicking parties all over the Big Apple. He formed the infamous Crack & Speed Records with his good Parisian friend Jef-k. On C&S he debuted his music as a part of the “super” group Mr. Negative & The Spencer Filipsson Experience.

During one of Holmar’s parties at a former brothel on the Lower East Side, he met Greg Oreck and shortly thereafter founded “Thugfucker”. After working together for a few years, during one hot summer night in Hólmar’s studio in Williamsburg, they created “Disco Gnome”. This record ended up being the first release on Life and Death Records and launched them into the international scene along with Tale of Us and Dj Tennis. He spent next years touring with Greg and fellow mates at Life and Death causing general mayhem and good times at clubs and festivals all around the globe. 

In 2011 he went to Burning Man for the first time, a pivotal moment for him, and now he can be found every year, riding his bike around and playing many marathon sets all week long. 

In recent years in addition to his work with "Thugfucker" he has started new collaborations. He co-founded “Lovestruckk” with Nico Stojan, “Theory of Light” with Brian Cid, “The Birds Fly South” with Maxxi Soundsystem and Beauty N the Beast with Philipp Jung.

In 2018 we saw his departure from “Thugfucker",  launching his solo career. In 2019 in addition to his acid tourist antics traveling all around the world and playing parties and festivals, he has released “The Mothership” E.P. on Get Physical and the “Disarmed” remix with Nico Stojan as Lovestruckk on Oüie Records. 

Recently he also brought his dancing shoes back out of retirement and has staged new impromptu of dance performances of the "Black Widows" on and off stage during his shows, staying true to his choreography roots…
