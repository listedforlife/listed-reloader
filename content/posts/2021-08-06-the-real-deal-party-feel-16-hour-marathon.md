Listed Productions, LIVING, and The Grass is Green are proud to present 

~* The Real Deal Party Feel *~

A 16-Hour Marathon Event At The Legendary Endup
6am-10pm Sunday, September 19th

A few old school Bay Area party people have come together for olds time's sake, to give back to the city and music community they love by creating an elevated experience that captures the fun, authentic vibes of the old glory days of clubbing and dance music through a modern lens.

Back in the day, the undisputed San Francisco go-to after-hours was The Endup. As the name implies, quite literally everyone in the city has ended up at this legendary staple at one point in their nightlife career. It has been the quintessential night-into-day playground for all walks of life (including home for many of Listedâ€™s celebrated PLAY parties), encouraging people to be themselves. This is the way itâ€™s been since they opened their doors in 1973 - now the world's longest running discotheque. ðŸ’ƒ

We return to this legendary space for an all-star lineup (to be announced) featuring some of our favorite artists from the Bay and beyond for a 16-hour marathon party across 3 stages starting Sunday at 6am, a nod to the golden era of San Francisco nightlife where The Endup reigned supreme. This is going to be a family affair, bringing back together our community for the unparalleled vibe that we all know, love, and miss. 

Get ready to relive that classic, old school atmosphere:

~* VENUE *~

Known as San Franciscoâ€™s most legendary after-hours nightclub since its founding in November 1973, The EndUp has remained on the cutting edge of San Francisco culture for nearly 40 years. Voted best late-night bar by Playboy Magazine and the best after-hours club in Best of the Bay, The Endup delivers premium nightlife and top-tier entertainment, creating a space where the two collide and merge. A uniquely intimate and interactive environment with a lush tropical patio and cascading waterfall, The EndUpâ€™s distinguished space and incomparable music scene have earned it acclaim with the most discerning party aficionados. 
 
~* HEALTH AND SAFETY *~

The health and safety of our community is our primary concern and comes before everything else. With that in mind, all attendees will be required to provide a negative PCR test result within 72 hours or proof of vaccine upon entry. In the case that we are not able to move forward with the show safely, we will offer refunds or entry to the rescheduled event. Thank you for your understanding.
