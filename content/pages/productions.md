  ## Listed Productions


  Listed is a SF based initiative that showcases cutting-edge EDM and strives to make it accessible via event productions and an artist agency. Our mission is to create unforgettable experiences with a warm, intimate vibe for our guests. We strive to make the partygoer as important as the headliner because we think the experience matters. Since its founding in San Francisco in 2005, listed has steadily expanded its reach to become an integral part of the dance music scene across other North American cities, most notably New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami, where its events and bookings artists are supported by an avid following of fans, artists and industry professionals.


  In addition to regularly featuring world-renowned talent and other exceptional, carefully chosen artists, listed Productions strives to create a warm and intimate vibe so that guests enjoy an unforgettable event, where their experience is paramount. listed parties have been memorable highlights of major dance music festivals, including BPM in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico, Love Parade in San Francisco, Movement in Detroit and the Winter Music Conference/Week in Miami.
