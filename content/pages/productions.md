  ## Listed Productions


  Listed is a SF based initiative that showcases cutting-edge EDM and strives to
  make it accessible via event productions and an artist agency. Our mission is
  to create unforgettable experiences with a warm, intimate vibe for our guests.
  We strive to make the partygoer as important as the headliner because we think
  the experience matters. Since its founding in San Francisco in 2005, listed
  has steadily expanded its reach to become an integral part of the dance music
  scene across other North American cities, most notably New York, Chicago, Los
  Angeles and Miami, where its events and bookings artists are supported by an
  avid following of fans, artists and industry professionals.


  In addition to regularly featuring world-renowned talent and other
  exceptional, carefully chosen artists, listed Productions strives to create a
  warm and intimate vibe so that guests enjoy an unforgettable event, where
  their experience is paramount. listed parties have been memorable highlights
  of major dance music festivals, including BPM in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico,
  Love Parade in San Francisco, Movement in Detroit and the Winter Music
  Conference/Week in Miami.
